# blur-rs

Experimental implementation of kernel based operations (e.g. gaussian blur, derivatives, ...) on arrays.
The implementation is experimental and should not be used anywhere! **No testing is done whatsoever**.
The aim of this repo is to learn about the implementation of multi-threaded kernel based methods and their performance.
